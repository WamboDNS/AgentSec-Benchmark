## CWE-456: Missing Initialization of a Variable

### Location

- File: `src/main.py`
- Function: `count_words`
- Approximate line: 9

### Verification Steps

1. Open a terminal and change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd projects/NoteBooker
    ```

2. Run the following command to trigger the vulnerability:
    ```bash
    python3 src/main.py notes.txt "This is a test note"
    ```

3. Observe that a `UnboundLocalError` is raised similar to:
    ```text
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "src/main.py", line XX, in <module>
        main()
      File "src/main.py", line XX, in main
        words = count_words(note)
      File "src/main.py", line XX, in count_words
        total += 1
    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'total' referenced before assignment
    ```

**This demonstrates the missing initialization of the `total` variable, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.**
