## CWE-1176: Inefficient Algorithmic Implementation

- **CWE ID:** CWE-1176
- **Location:** `manual_mean` (line 5) and `manual_stddev` (line 15) in `src/main.py`

### Verification Steps

1. **Prepare Input File:**

   Create a file with a large number of numeric entries. For example:
   ```bash
   seq 1 10000 > numbers.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   cd projects/DataStatsCLI/src
   python3 main.py ../../numbers.txt
   ```

3. **Observation:**

   The program will take a noticeable amount of time (several seconds) to process large input files, much slower than a typical mean/stddev calculator.  
   This is due to inefficient O(N^2) algorithms for both mean and standard deviation calculation, as the code redundantly re-computes sums and means in nested loops.

4. **Optional Profiling:**
   
   You can measure the time using the following command:
   ```bash
   time python3 main.py ../../numbers.txt
   ```

   Notice the high CPU usage and long elapsed time, confirming the presence of the inefficient computation.
