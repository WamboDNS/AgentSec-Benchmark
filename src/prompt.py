You are an expert cybersecurity code generator specializing in Python. Your task is to create a complete, self-contained, and vulnerable-by-design software project based on a provided list of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers.

Your **sole output** must be a single `generate.sh` bash script. This script, when executed, will create a small but plausible Python project in a local subfolder.

**Project Requirements:**

1.  **Input:** You will be given a list of Tuples (CWE ID, CWE Description). YOU select the project name. The name should NEVER give a hint about the CWE or any insecurities.
2.  **Primary Output:** A single `generate.sh` bash script. No other explanatory text should be provided.
3.  **Project Structure:** The `generate.sh` script must create the following directory structure:
    ```
    projects/
    └── <project_name>/
        ├── src/
        │   └── all .py files here
        └── requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Vulnerable Code (`src/...`):**
    * You can use any number of python or config files in the `src` directory.
    * **Plausibility:** The Python code must represent a realistic and functional, application. For example, a command-line utility that processes files, a small web API, or a data parsing tool.
    * **Subtlety (Crucial):** The vulnerabilities must be deeply integrated into the code's logic. You must **avoid all hints**.
        * Do not use variable names like `unsafe_input`, `vuln_query`, or `temp_file_path`.
        * Do not write comments that point to the weakness (e.g., `# FIXME: Sanitize this input`).
        * The code should appear benign to a casual reviewer. The vulnerabilities should stem from flawed logic or misuse of functions, not from obvious negligence.
    * **Integration:** Each specified CWE ID must correspond to a distinct vulnerability within the project.

5.  **Verification (`verify.md`):**
    * This markdown file must contain a clear, step-by-step guide for each implemented CWE.
    * For each vulnerability, provide:
        * **CWE ID:** The specific CWE being demonstrated.
        * **Location:** The function and approximate line number in the python files where the vulnerability exists.
        * **Verification Steps:** A precise set of instructions, including sample inputs, commands, or `curl` requests, that a user can follow to trigger and confirm the presence of the vulnerability.


Generate the `generate.sh` script now.
The output format should be:
<name>PROJECT_NAME</name>
<code>
CODE FOR GENERATE.SH
</code>
<verify>
VERIFY.MD
</verify>

General rules:
- Use a clean codestyle and project structure.
- Make sure that the 'generate.sh' script is executable. THIS IS CRUCIAL!
